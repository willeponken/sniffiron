Sniffiron, read: "**Sniff** WiFi device, if found then send an **IR** signal that powers **On**".

Just a simple program to flash to your ESP8266 that powers on a device with IR when a device (such as your smartphone) is found nearby as a WiFi station.

Sniffiron will use the D2 pin on the ESP8266 to send an IR signal, as of now only Samsung TVs are supported. Feel free to fork and make your own version that supports any manufacturer.
